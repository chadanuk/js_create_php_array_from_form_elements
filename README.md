Create a php array for use in form processing from a HTML form using jQuery

This script looops through all the elments in a form using jQuery and outputs  a text  string that can be pasted into a PHP file to return an array of all the form elements - useful for generating a one-off form in PHP where you need some simple validation and want to store the data in an array.
